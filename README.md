# Installer Example
An installer that you can modify to your liking.

If you need an installer to use for installing other apps, or you just want to
use this as an installer template, use this.

Make sure to give me credit if you use this in any projects.
Thank you.

(NOTE: In configuration, the Program Size and Free Disk Space counters are not done yet. Either you can make your own, or remove them.)
